# Python and Portguol Exercises

## About the repository

This repository makes public a lot of exercises of programming fundamentals. Basics algorithms made up with Python 3.
You will find out them as they are when I submit

This repository makes public various programming exercises. Basic algorithms written in Python 3 and [Portugol](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugol) pseudocode.

## Warnings
 - You will find them as they were when I submitted them, so you may find errors. Some files may be missing.
 - Some PDFs with it's questions are missing, so I'm working recreating by what the code appear to do. You will be adviced in the Index section.
 - PDFs autors isn't me, and didn't include me. References in the PDFs.
 - This repository is still being built. Something new could appear :)

## Organization
I divide between list folders and algorithm folders. The organization is still being improved.
